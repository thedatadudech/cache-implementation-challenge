TRUE PARALLELISM METRICS EXPLAINED
===================================

1. THROUGHPUT (ops/sec)
   - The actual number of operations completed per second
   - Higher is better
   - This is the most honest metric for comparing implementations

2. AVERAGE TIME PER OPERATION
   - How long each cache operation takes on average
   - Lower is better
   - Includes all overhead (locking, coordination, etc.)

3. ESTIMATED SPEEDUP
   - How much faster than single-threaded execution
   - Python: ~1x (GIL prevents parallelism)
   - Java/Rust: Can approach number of workers (100x theoretical max)

4. CPU EFFICIENCY
   - What percentage of available CPU cores are actually utilized
   - Python: ~1% (only 1 core out of 100 workers)
   - Java/Rust: Higher percentages show better parallelism

WHY PYTHON SHOWS HIGH "PARALLELISM FACTOR" BUT LOW REAL PERFORMANCE:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The original "parallelism factor" metric was calculated as:
  (avg_operation_time Ã— num_operations) / total_elapsed_time

This is misleading because:
- It compares theoretical sequential time vs actual time
- Python's fast operations (microseconds) create a high ratio
- But the GIL prevents actual parallel execution
- The threads mostly just add overhead without speedup

WHAT MATTERS FOR REAL APPLICATIONS:
------------------------------------
1. Throughput (ops/sec) - How many requests can you handle?
2. Latency (ns/op) - How fast is each request?
3. Scalability - Does adding more workers actually help?

For CPU-bound operations like our cache:
- Python: No benefit from threading (GIL)
- Java: Good parallelism with some GC overhead
- Rust: Best parallelism with minimal overhead
